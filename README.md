# Pure SU(2) Yang Mills equations of motion 
 Symbolic computation of yang mills equations of motion in sympy


Computation of the Yang Mills equations of motion can be a very demanding task which requires 
a lot of time. This python code gives you the ability to extract the pure Yang Mills Equations of motion
in cartesian, spherical or cylindrical coordinate system. Furthermore you can select the dependences
of your fields (only time dependent, only static, t-kx etc.). You can also compute the lagrangian, the hamiltonian
the chromoelectric/magnetic fields and the Energy-Momentum Tensor.
